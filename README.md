# KOMPASSI-Renderer-Plugin
VST/LV2/VST3 plugins of the KOMPASSI-Renderer

This is a demo implementation of our new parametric spatial audio renderer for headphone or loudspeaker rendering of multichannel recordings. It retains the flexibility of our earlier method called COMPASS [1, 2, 3] while improving significantly in terms of robustness and audio quality. It uses a new and more advanced parametric model of the sound scene, and an improved rendering solution. The demo plugin is limited at the moment to Ambisonic input and head-tracked binaural delivery, but we intend to gradually update the plugin with additional functionality, such as loudspeaker rendering for flexible setups, and support for custom microphone arrays.

We call the improved method nCOMPASS - a detailed technical report on it will be published soon.
